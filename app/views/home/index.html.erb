<p>The idea for Mamajamas was born out of my own experience as an expecting mom three years ago.</p>
<p>I was overwhelmed by the process of figuring out what to get in  preparation. I spent hours researching products online and emailed mom  friends asking for advice.  They sent me long spreadsheets.  After sifting through everything, I had to then create my own &ldquo;master&rdquo;  spreadsheet to keep myself organized.</p>
<p>I starting thinking there must be an easier way to get this kind of information. I wanted to get recommendations from my  friends without having to sift through their spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I found out that many of my new mom friends were having the  same experience. I also learned that the long process of figuring out  what to get doesn&rsquo;t end when the baby is born. At each new phase of  their development you need new things.</p>
<p>The goal of Mamajamas is to help new and expecting parents buy only  stuff they need â€” to help them spend less time thinking about  stuff and more time enjoying pregnancy and new parenthood.</p>
<p>I hope Mamajamas is helpful to you during this exciting time!</p>
