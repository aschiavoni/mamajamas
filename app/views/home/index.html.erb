<p>The idea for Mamajamas was born out of my own experience as an expecting mom three years ago.</p>
<p>I was overwhelmed by the process of figuring out what to get in preparation. I spent hours researching products online and emailed mom friends asking for advice. They sent me long spreadsheets. After sifting through everything, I had to then create my own “master” spreadsheet to keep myself organized.</p>
<p>I starting thinking there must be an easier way to get this kind of information. I wanted to get recommendations from my friends without having to sift through their spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I found out that many of my new mom friends were having the same experience. I also learned that the long process of figuring out what to get doesn’t end when the baby is born. At each new phase of their development you need new things.</p>
<p>The goal of Mamajamas is to help new and expecting parents buy only stuff they need — to help them spend less time thinking about stuff and more time enjoying pregnancy and new parenthood.</p>
<p>I hope Mamajamas is helpful to you during this exciting time!</p>
