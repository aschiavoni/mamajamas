  Are family and friends planning to celebrate your pending arrival with a baby shower? If so, we hope it’s filled with love, laughter and a gazillion luscious cupcakes.

  You’ll want to make sure everyone has the link to your Mamajamas registry – that way you can avoid getting seven copies of “Goodnight Moon.” I mean, it’s a good book, but come on.

  A lot of moms like to include it on the shower invitations. That way no one has to go hunting for it.

  Have a fabulous shower. Bask in the joy of being YOU at this moment in time. And no matter what, we hope you don’t have to play that game where everyone tries to guess the measurement of your belly! Surely, a man invented that game.

  We hope you are enjoying every moment of this fabulous ride.
