Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

So you had your baby! Wow, huh? You’re madly in love, you’re up to your elbows in diapers, and you’re realizing sleep deprivation is a lot like jet lag but with more spit-up. You’ve also had a chance to try out much of the new gear that was gifted to you on your baby registry.

This is a great time to come back to your baby registry and turn it into a list of recommendations for your expecting friends.

Simply login to Mamajamas at <%= root_url %> and:

●	Rate the products on your list that you’ve used
●	Delete the ones you haven’t
●	Add and rate other favorite gear from any website by using the Mamajamas bookmark. You can find more information at <%= faq_url(anchor: 'faq06') %>

Be sure to send your new list along to your expecting parent friends. They be SO grateful for your wisdom. It’s amazing what you can learn in a few months, isn’t it?!

Wishing you baby giggles and four hours of uninterrupted sleep,
The Mamajamas Team
