Hi <%= @display_name %>,

Congrats on creating a Mamajamas registry. By doing so, you have just made your life a little easier. We are going to help you figure out everything you need for that fabulous new baby.

  * Browse other registries and top baby experts for gift ideas at <%= new_friend_url %>.

  * Get the Mamajamas Bookmark so you can add any product from the web to your registry. Learn more at <%= faq_url(anchor: "faq05") %>.

Youâ€™ll also want to share your registry with family and friends. (Because who needs five diaper pails, right?!) To do so, use the share button on the top right of your registry. Or go old school and copy and paste the following link:

<%= public_list_url(@user) %>

(You can use this link on your shower invites too.)

We hope Mamajamas will help you spend less time thinking about stuff, and more time enjoying pregnancy and new parenthood.

If you have any questions, you can email me at angie@mamajamas.com. I'd love to hear from you.

Best of luck with all that lies ahead!

Best,
Angie Schiavoni
Founder, Mamajamas
